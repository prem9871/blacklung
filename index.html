  <h1> writing assignment 1</h1>
   <p>Out of all the social networking sites I have ever used. One social network I have used, and I must admit that it is excellently crafted, is Instagram. 
Its design stands out the most compared to other social media apps is easy use for its users.
In addition, more creative, stylish elements are added in such a way that it will make you feel that the application is fun and easy to use. Let’s take the example of sharing pictures and videos.
Within few efforts you can upload your photos and videos for the world to see which also ecourages you post more as to how easy it is. In order to keep their audience interested, Instagram creates various promotional projects for their application, looking into other business models.
Instagram also elaborates how their audience includes teenagers that are actively tweeting and posting thousands of photos, thus, emphasizing self-creation and participation.
teenagers repeatedly visit the app because the feeds are personalized thanks to the recommendation algorithm.
For example instagram reels have an algorithm which makes the users hooked to it by showing short video clips they like to see.</p>  
<p>Software design is an important aspect as this influences the extent to which a user will be satisfied and engage in the given application. 
An application with a quality design does not only make users to come but also keep them to provide the proper flow. 
A good design encompasses practical, eassily usable and visually pleasant that enable users to achieve their entertainment in a comfortable manner. 
Or in simpler words, if the design is more confusing and less user friendly; then customers will not use the application.</p>  

<p>For the above reasons, it is evident that software design must be carried out with a lot of intelligence so that such applications cater for the needs and 
expectations of the users and hence succeed in the competitive environment.</p>

  <p>The main idea of the requirement gathering stage in software development is to understand the needs of the users and stakeholders from the software product.
    Clear information must be gathered about what the software should be able to do, what features it should have, and what rules or limitations exist for the software. 
    The developers and project teams then hold interviews, surveys, and workshops in this stage to collect insights and negotiate expectations. 
    They produce documents like the requirement specifications that outline all the details of importance. This is a crucial stage since it lays the 
    foundation for the entire development process. Once the developers comprehend what needs to be done, then they can generate a strategy that would
    indeed meet user expectations and avoid costly changes later. Clear requirements help ensure the usefulness, effectiveness, and fit of the user
    needs of the resulting product. This also ensures proper use of time and resources during the execution of the project, hence reducing the occurrence
    of misunderstandings or skipped features. In general, requirement gathering makes for a successful software product.</p>.
<p> Five user stories.
 <p> - As a user, i want to upload photos amd videos from my device so that i can share my experiences.</p>
  <p> - As a user, i want to apply fliters to my photos so that i can enhance their appearance.</p>
   <p>- As a user, i want to tag other users in my posts so that i can include them in my experiences.</p>
   <p>- As a user, i wnat to explore trending content on my for you page so that i can discover new posts and accounts.</p>

    <h1>Communications Among the Various Aspects Of Software Developement</h1>

This practice is vital to software design mainly because it aids in coordination between developers, designers, and stakeholders. 
    Each level of development falls into a communication breakdown that results in misunderstandings, delays, and costly mistakes hence 
    the need to ensure effective communication between all the teams. In software design, there are clearly three aspects of communications,
    namely, message clarity, perceptual listening and perceptual response.

This is because expectations are clearly stated at the business level, and everybody knows what they are expected to deliver. When instructions
    are clear, there is improved performance as opposed to when a team makes mistakes because of clarifying the instructions themselves. The other
    is active listening, which is equally important to assure that all the members of a team feel being heard and are ready to cooperate for
    the sake of sharing ideas. And last but not least, feedback also must be noted because it is not only a way to check the results and make 
    amendments on the way in case of spotting problems early.

A personal experience that best describes this concept of communication is as follows: During a football match, one small instance of
    'broken' communication within my team was when we, the players of AS heard the wrong instructions for coverage of zones from our 
    coach and we as players made mistakes by placing ourselves in the wrong position, hence missing out on stopping the opponent. 
    But that would not have been possible if the plan had been defined beforehand. This lesson directly 
    influences the software design: The team dynamic utilized while team members do not clearly communicate can be highly destructive to
    the project. Interaction depicts how software teams can enhance the quality and efficiency of the software in development to deliver improved projects.

    Design Principle: Face-to-Face Communication There must be direct, in-person interaction. This will be further elaborated as required by 
    agile software development: immediate engagement among its team members so that a better understanding is achieved without many chances of
    misunderstanding occurring. In software development, face-to-face communication is one of the valuable design principles that allow for problem
    anticipation and resolution, reduces the likelihood of communication breakdowns, and strengthens team bonds.
    
    Facilitating self-expression through nonverbal cues, such as body language and vocal intonation, face-to-face communication ensures that important
    information will not be misinterpreted nor lost. A good example is the stand-up meeting held daily within agile work streams. These short
    meetings provide assurance that attendees are kept updated on any progress with regards to issues and planning of the future while allowing
    timely adjustments to work out any issues that arise. The second example refers to in-person design reviews, where developers and 
    stakeholders review prototypes or features collaboratively. In fact, these conversations often bring much more insight and result in more
    innovative solutions than do asynchronous reviews done through mechanisms like E-Past or Chat. In either case, direct human interaction
    improves the user experience by ensuring the final product is closer to meeting the user's needs and preferences.
    When used in the right way, it can enable collaboration, reduce project timelines and lead to more intuitive designs, user centered.
